# Mechatronics-Project-Arduino-code
Project Proposal:
Developed a mechanism that would radially compress the flow diverters and allow 
an electronic system to detect and collect the force versus displacement data 
during the testing process. The prototype of the mechanism was 3D printed. 
The loadcell has been implemented to detect the force using an Arduino. The 
mechanism is operated using a linear actuator connected to the Arduino for a 
precise displacement control. The data is transmitted to a computer for data 
acquisition and the mechanism has been operated via command input through a 
Bluetooth module to satisfy the IOT (Internet of things) requirement from the 
Mechatronics project.
